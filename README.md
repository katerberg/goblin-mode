# Goblin Mode

A game where you try to manage your goblin horde as they try to escape a demon accidentally released from the depths of their home.

This game was a pre-work test bed for the 2023 [7 Day Roguelike](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2023) development challenge. While it technically is a complete game, it has very little polish since it was mostly an experimentation platform. It only works on mobile devices and has pretty minimal UI instructions.
